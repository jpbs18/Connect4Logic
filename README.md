## How to Use?

The game is played with two players. The game starts when you run the server and two players arrive.
The game objective is to make four(R or Y) in a vertical, or horizontal or diagnonal line.
When the board is completed with 42 plays that it is a draw.
When a player wins, the game asks both players if they want to play again.
The server allows to run multiple games at the same time.

Have FUN!! ;)
