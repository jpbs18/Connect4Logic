The project was built using Java language in IntelliJ IDE.
The main objective was to build a piece of software where you could run a multiplayer game using multithreading and a TCP protocol.


## Code Style

It was applied a Client server pattern were you could run the game and allow interaction between the players.

## How to Use?

The game is played with two players. The game starts when you run the server and two players arrive.
The game objective is to make four(R or Y) in a vertical, or horizontal or diagnonal line.
When the board is completed with 42 plays that it is a draw.
When a player wins, the game asks both players if they want to play again.
The server allows to run multiple games at the same time.

Have FUN!! ;)
